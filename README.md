# ReplicationSurveys
Replication does not measure scientific productivity
<h1>System Requirements</h1>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
Our data and analysis were conducted on a linux server with sixty-four 2.6GHz CPUs and 256GB RAM. 
It has a 256GB primary disk partition on an RAID1 SSD and an 8TB secondary partition for home directories on a RAID6 storage array.
This is overkill and this could should run fine on any computer made in the last decade.  
</h2>Software</h2> 
This code using python and requires that you have python3 installed on your system. 
To install 
<h1>Replicating the analysis</h1>
<h2>Data access</h2>
Data from Camerer et al 2016, Errington et al 2021, and 
<h2>Installation</h2>
Detailed installation instructions are included on <a href=https://osf.io/2dcer/wiki/home/>OSF</a>. Installation time will vary depending upon
what you already have installed, typically no more than 30 minutes. 
<h2>Running the code</h2>
Running the code is the same as running any other Jupyter notebook. On our machine, it took approximately 8 hours using 
a fraction of the resources. It may take several hours/multiple days depending upon your system specifications
<h2>Replicating the results</h2>
The jupyter notebook reproduces all results exactly as they are presented in the paper.
